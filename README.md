# KernelKafe ☕

Welcome to KernelKafe - where we (system programming enthusiasts) gather to explore the depths of computer architecture, operating systems, and low-level programming concepts!

## 🌟 About KernelKafe

KernelKafe was born from the idea that understanding computer systems from the ground up is both challenging and fascinating. The name combines two essential elements:
- **Kernel**: The core component of an operating system that manages system resources and hardware - representing our focus on fundamental computer science concepts
- **Kafe**: A cozy space where people gather to share ideas and learn together (with a 'K' to maintain the alliteration and add a tech twist!)

## 📚 Reading Club

Our reading club is designed to create a structured learning environment where members can dive deep into essential computer science texts and research papers.
