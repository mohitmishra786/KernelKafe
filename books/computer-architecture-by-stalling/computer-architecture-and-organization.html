                        <p>We will read 2 chapter over a week timeline (we can increase the chapter, if everyone is comfortable with it) and discuss over a Discord (each chapter channel will be created). Your email will be required to send the invites.</p>
                    </section> (as chapters are big, we can discuss and increase the time as per chapters page)

                        <h2>Medium of discussion</h2>
                        <p>All discussions will be done over discord channel (so make sure to join the discord server, you can get the link to the discord in the above description). We can plan of having basic calls over discord void channel to discuss more about the chapters. There won't be any particular fix time for the discord calls for now as this will allow people to read at their own pace asynchronously, and still be able to participate in the discussion.</p>
